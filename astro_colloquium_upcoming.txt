20220309%%%16:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Unnikrishnan Sureshkumar%%%Jagiellonian University%%%Connection between galaxy properties and environment in the cosmic structure%%%Galaxies live in dark matter haloes and hence the galaxy properties are majorly defined by the properties of the haloes. Thus the environmental dependence of dark matter halo properties prompts a correlation between galaxy properties and the environment. In this talk, I will discuss the results from our recent works (arXiv:2102.04177 and arXiv:2201.10480) that explored how luminosities in various passbands and the associated galaxy properties are correlated with the environment. We used a set of 3.4 micro-m luminosity-selected and stellar mass-selected galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We made use of the galaxy two-point correlation functions and marked correlation functions to investigate the environmental correlations. I will also discuss the impact of various selection effects on the galaxy clustering measurements.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%usureshkumar.jpg%%%-%%%ukp1513[at]gmail.com%%%-

20220316%%%12:00 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 2, Hercus Theatre (+Zoom)%%%Associate Professor Michelle Cluver%%%Swinburne University%%%The Case for the Nearby Universe in High Definition%%%It’s a tale of three very different surveys: WISE (a mid-infrared imaging survey of the entire sky), 4HS (a newly accepted redshift survey of the southern hemisphere on 4MOST), and MeerHoGS (a pilot HI survey on MeerKAT). This talk will focus on the key science goals of 4HS (which I co-PI with Ned Taylor) and how this connects to my work using WISE and MeerKAT to a) create a benchmark view of the nearby universe, and b) investigate how environment influences the properties of galaxies. Finally, I will illustrate the power of immersive visualisation tools (such as VR) in this intrinsically multi-dimensional space.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow%%%mcluver.jpg%%%-%%%mcluver[at]swin.edu.au%%%-

20220413%%%12:00 p.m.%%%Zoom%%%Dr Yisheng Qiu%%%Zhejiang University%%%Starduster: A multi-wavelength SED model based on radiative transfer simulations and deep learning%%%In this talk, I will introduce Starduster, a supervised deep learning model that predicts the multi-wavelength SED from galaxy geometry parameters and star formation history by emulating dust radiative transfer simulations. The model is comprised of three specifically designed neural networks, which take into account the features of dust attenuation and emission. We utilise the Skirt radiative transfer simulation to produce data for the training data of neural networks. Each neural network can be trained using ∼4000−5000 samples. Compared with the direct results of the Skirt simulation, our deep learning model produces 0.1−0.2 mag errors in FUV to FIR wavelengths. At some bands, the uncertainty is only 0.01 mag. As an application, we fit our model to the observed SEDs of IC4225 and NGC5166. Our model can reproduce the observations, and successfully predicts that both IC4225 and NGC5166 are edge-on galaxies. However, the predicted geometry parameters are different from image-fitting studies. Our analysis implies that the inconsistency is mainly due to the degeneracy in the star formation history of the stellar disk and bulge. In addition, we find that the predicted fluxes at 20μm−80μm by our SED model are correlated with bulge radius. Our SED code is public available and can be applied to both SED-fitting and SED-modelling of galaxies from semi-analytic models.%%%-%%%-%%%yqiu.png%%%-%%%yishengq[at]126.com%%%-
