Post-main-sequence stars -- pulsars, white dwarfs and giant branch stars -- all host planetary systems, which often include remnant debris discs. Here I provide a review of our current knowledge of these systems. I show how this interdisciplinary field incorporates several facets of stellar physics and chemistry as well as solar system physics and chemistry, and detail simulation-based efforts to understand the big picture.%%%-%%%STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellow%%%dveras.jpg%%%-%%%d.veras[at]warwick.ac.uk%%%-

The main observable manifestation of the IGM,  the Lyman-alpha forest, has provided important constraints on the linear matter power spectrum, especially when combined with cosmic microwave background data. This includes, most notably, the tightest constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) models, that I will present in this talk.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%virsic.jpg%%%-%%%irsic[at]uw.edu%%%-

20180405%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Andy Casey%%%Monash University%%%The lithium-rich giant star puzzle%%%All theoretical models of stellar evolution predict that most of the lithium inside a star is destroyed as the star becomes a red giant. However, observations reveal that about 1% of red giants are peculiarly rich in lithium, often exceeding the amount in the interstellar medium or predicted from the Big Bang. With only 151 lithium-rich giants discovered in the past four decades, and no distinguishable properties other than lithium enhancement, the origin of lithium-rich giant stars is one of the oldest problems in stellar astrophysics. In this talk I will report on the discovery of 2,330 low-mass lithium-rich giant stars, and a likely solution to this longstanding puzzle.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%acasey.jpeg%%%-%%%andrew.casey[at]monash.edu%%%-

20180321%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Ben Forrest%%%Texas A&M University%%%Using Composite Spectral Energy Distributions to Characterize Galaxy Populations at 1&lt;z&lt;4%%%With increasing sample sizes and multiwavelength photometric coverage of distant galaxies through surveys such as CANDELS, NMBS, and ZFOURGE, the available data at high redshift has grown significantly in the last decade.  By de-redshifting and scaling photometry of many tens to hundreds of galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions, we can create low resolution spectra (R~50), quantifying features such as emission line equivalent widths with more precision than possible for a single galaxy without spectroscopy. In this talk I will detail the use of this method with ~7000 high signal to noise galaxies from the ZFOURGE survey. This allows us to identify and characterize populations of galaxies in the green valley, which show morphologies, dust content, and star formation rates between those of star-forming and quenched populations. I will also discuss those galaxies with extreme nebular emission in the young universe, which may be analogs to those which played a role in cosmic reionization.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%bforrest.jpg%%%-%%%bforrest[at]physics.tamu.edu%%%-

I will present current and near future simulations, how they compare to state-of-the-art work done else where, I will also discuss how we will tackle the variety of large scientific questions in ASTRO 3D's other programmes.

20180314%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Ryan Shannon%%%Swinburne University%%%The fast radio bursts population as observed by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder%%%Fast radio bursts  (FRBs) remain one of the most exciting and confounding classes of astronomical transients.  There is mounting evidence that these bright, dispersed pulses of radio emission originate at cosmological (gigaparsec) distances.  Not only do the energetics of the events point to a new radiative process, but the pulses are imprinted with propagation through the ionised intergalactic medium and cosmic web, making them invaluable probes of media invisible to most other types of observations.   Despite considerable effort to detect additional bursts, the yields have been low because of relatively narrow fields of view of most searches.  Here I will present the discovery of 20 FRBs from a wide-area survey conducted with the Australia Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP),  nearly doubling the total number of known FRBs in only one year of surveying.  The burst properties suggest a cosmologically evolving population with a wide luminosity function.    I will then discuss future plans to develop interferometric fast transient capabilities with ASKAP, necessary to harness the full value of FRBs.    To conclude, I will present the very recent discovery of two FRBs with the  Parkes telescope, one of which is the highest signal-to-noise ratio burst seen to date.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%rshannon.JPG%%%-%%%Ryan.Shannon[at]csiro.au%%%-

20180307%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Stefan Oslowski%%%Swinburne University%%%Pulsar timing arrays%%%The gravitational wave spectrum spans a large range of frequencies with various experiments covering different parts of the spectrum. At the low end of the spectrum, in the nanoHertz regime, we use so-called Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) to try and detect gravitational waves. PTAs observe tens of millisecond pulsars spread throughout our Galaxy to form a galactic-scale detector. The primary signal PTAs attempt to detect are mergers of supermassive blackholes but we are also sensitive to more exotic sources like cosmic strings. During this talk I'll provide you with an overview of the history of PTAs, current efforts and struggles, as well as the outlook into the bright future.%%%-%%%Laureate Fellowship Postdoctoral Research Fellow%%%soslowski.jpg%%%-%%%stefanoslowski[at]swin.edu.au%%%-

20180228%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Yvonne Wong%%%University of New South Wales%%%Neutrino cosmology%%%Neutrinos are the most weakly interacting and one of the lightest particles in the standard model of particle physics.  Ironically, while these characteristics make the neutrino elusive in the laboratory, they are precisely what makes neutrinos the most abundant known subatomic particle in the universe, averaging about 300 particles per cubic centimetre today.  The sheer number of these particles makes them an important participant in many cosmological processes, from the primordial synthesis of light elements, to the formation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the large-scale cosmic structures.  In this talk I will review the role played by neutrinos in these processes.%%%-%%%Senior Lecturer%%%ywong.jpg%%%-%%%yvonne.y.wong[at]unsw.edu.au%%%-

20180221%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Christopher Usher%%%Liverpool John Moores University%%%Using Globular Cluster Stellar Populations to Understand Galaxy Formation%%%Globular clusters are important tools to help us understand how galaxies form and evolve. Globular cluster formation tells us about the conditions of extreme star formation while their survival from high redshift tell us about the processes of galaxy assembly. Being much brighter than red giant stars, globular clusters allow the stellar populations of galaxies to be studied at much greater distances. Thus a wider range of galaxy masses, environments and morphologies to be studied than can be with resolved stars. Using data from the WAGGS survey of massive star clusters in the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies and the SLUGGS survey of the globular cluster systems of massive early-type galaixes, I will talk about how we can measure the metallicities of globular clusters using the strength of the calcium triplet in integrated light. Using globular cluster metallicity distributions and the relationships between globular cluster colour and metallicity, I will present evidence that different galaxies with similar masses experienced different formation histories. I will compare these observations with the predictions of the E-MOSAICS cosmological simulations of the formation of globular cluster systems. I will also talk about how the E-MOSAICS simulations have allowed to us to understand how globular cluster colour distributions vary with globular cluster luminosity (the 'blue tilt').%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Assistant %%%cusher.jpg%%%-%%%c.g.usher[at]ljmu.ac.uk%%%-

20180214%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Themiya Nanayakkara%%%Leiden Observatory%%%Hunting for the first stars I: Attempts to demystify He II with MUSE%%%In the quest for identifying pop-III stars, the most sought-after emission line is He II, however, stellar population models are unable to accurately predict the He II features while being consistent with other emission line diagnostics. To produce He II ionizing photons, stellar populations require sources of hard ionizing radiation with energies >= 54.4 eV and sources such as AGN, shocks, X-Ray binaries, stellar rotation and/or binary stellar evolution, and post-AGB stars have been suggested as possible contributors. To accurately identify relative contributions from these wide variety of sources, high signal-to-noise spectra with rest-frame UV/optical coverage and advanced stellar population/photoionization models are required.<p>The VLT/MUSE GTO program has obtained deep ≈10-30h exposures of the Hubble legacy fields yielding rest-UV spectra of galaxies at z≈2-6. In this talk I will present recent results of the MUSE program, where we compare the z=2-4 He II emitters with expectations from photoionization modelling to explore their stellar population and ISM conditions. I will compare our results with recent results from local samples of high-redshift ‘analogues’ to show the different parameter spaces probed by local and high-redshift galaxies in the rest-UV. I will address the necessity to obtain high signal-to-noise spectra of individual galaxies to model rest UV emission and absorption systems along with auxiliary rest-NIR lines to constrain stellar population properties of galaxies at high-z, which will be aided by combined studies by MUSE and JWST in future.%%%-%%%Postdoc%%%tnanayakkara.jpg%%%-%%%nanayakkara[at]strw.leidenuniv.nl%%%-

LEGUS, a HST Treasury program of 50 nearby galaxies imaged at UV and optical wavelengths, is now providing us the information to test the overall organization and spatial evolution of star formation. I will present my latest findings of using star clusters from LEGUS combined with millimeter observations to trace the hierarchy of the entire star-forming process to improve our understanding of the evolution of star formation, stellar populations, and the natal molecular gas in galaxies.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%kgrasha.jpg%%%ngc1566_legus.jpg%%%kgrasha[at]astro.umass.edu%%%-

It now appears that radio-wave scattering is caused primarily by dense plasma organised in radial filaments around hot stars. The resulting picture of the circumstellar plasma environment looks much like the Helix Nebula, where ionised filaments arise as the cometary tails of tiny molecular clouds. I'll describe the observational developments and their interpretation, and I'll sketch some broad astrophysical implications.%%%-%%%Director%%%mwalker.jpg%%%-%%%Mark.Walker[at]manlyastrophysics.org%%%mwalker.pdf

The new era of gravitational-wave astronomy has started. In addition to the transient signals, searches are under way for weaker, persistent, quasimonochromatic signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars. In this talk, I will describe two interesting types of continuous gravitational-wave sources (neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries and young supernova remnants), discuss the challenges in the searches, introduce the methods we have developed to surmount the difficulties, and explain the results obtained from analyzing the LIGO observational data.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%lsun.jpg%%%-%%%lings2[at]student.unimelb.edu.au%%%lsun.pdf

20171211%%%2.15 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 6 Geoff Opat room%%%Liju Philip%%%University of KwaZulu-Natal%%%Searching for cosmic dawn from the sub-Antarctic%%%Observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hyDr.ogen can potentially help us probe the uncharted epochs in the universe’s history. One such epoch is “cosmic dawn,” when the first luminous objects lit up the universe, a few hunDr.ed million years after the big bang. The radiation from first stars heated the intergalactic medium, imprinting a characteristic signature in the evolution of the globally averaged 21-cm signal when observed as a function of frequency. The 21-cm spectrum is expected to have a ~100 mK absorption feature at a redshift of approximately 20 (frequency of ~70 MHz). This dip corresponds to the heating of the ambient neutral hyDr.ogen by the first stars and is observationally undetected to date.</p><p>We present a new global signal experiment called Probing Radio Intensity at high-Z from Marion (PRIZM). PRIZM consists of two antennas with center frequencies of 70 and 100 MHz operating in the 30–200 MHz frequency band. The instrument observes from Marion Island in the southern Indian ocean, halfway between the continents of Africa and Antarctica. The pristine radio-quiet environment of Marion makes it an excellent location for low-frequency observations. PRIZM observes in dual-polarization mode and uses a Smart Network ADC Processor (SNAP) FPGA board for backend digital signal processing. I will discuss the deployment of PRIZM to Marion during the three-week relief voyage in April 2017.  I will present the challenges and lessons learned during the deployment, our assessment of the RFI environment on Marion Island, and preliminary science results from the data collected during the relief voyage. I will also discuss prospects for future radio measurements from Marion that will extend to even lower frequencies.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%lphilip.jpg%%%PRIZM.jpg%%%lijuphil[at]gmail.com%%%lphilip.pdf

However, at present the astrophysics of reionisation are poorly constrained and understood. In order to quantify what we can learn from current and future experiments I developed 21CMMC, a Bayesian analysis tool which performs full 3D semi-numerical simulations on the fly. Using the recovered fractional precision on astrophysical parameters as a figure of merit, 21CMMC has wide ranging applicability to the EoR community. In this talk, I will introduce 21CMMC and discuss several of its applications.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%bgreig.png%%%-%%%greigb[at]unimelb.edu.au%%%bgreig.pdf

The goal of this is to constrain cosmological parameters from lensing measurements of structure in the evolved Universe. The combination of two-point correlation functions provides information on the amplitude of density fluctuations (S8=0.794+0.029-0.027) and the dark energy equation of state (w=-0.80+0.20-0.22) that is competitive with Planck CMB data. When joint with probes of cosmic geometry, it yields the best measurement of these parameters to date. Besides reviewing these results and the technical advances that facilitated them, I will also present work that provides a DES lensing view of higher than second moments of the matter density field.%%%Special date%%%Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow%%%dgruen.jpg%%%-%%%dgruen[at]stanford.edu%%%dgruen.pdf

At moderate redshifts (1 < z < 5) the spatial magnification allows us to examine the kinematics and morphologies of ‘normal’ star-forming galaxies, revealing the processes that lead to the clumpy star formation observed in this epoch. At the highest redshifts (6 < z < 10), the flux magnification from lensing allows us to directly observe dwarf galaxies in the first billion years of the Universe, probing the faint end of the luminosity function where the majority of the ionizing photons that contribute to reionization originate. I will also discuss prospects for JWST in studying the first galaxies and the epoch of reionization.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%rlivermore.png%%%-%%%r.c.livermore[at]astro.as.utexas.edu%%%rlivermore.pdf

20171101%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Simon Stevenson%%%Swinburne University%%%Insights into binary black hole formation from gravitational waves%%%In its first observing run (O1), Advanced LIGO detected gravitational waves from two binary black hole mergers, GW150914 and GW151226, along with a statistically less significant candidate LVT151012. The Advanced LIGO detectors were joined by the Advanced Virgo detector in the recently concluded second observing run (O2). Another two binary black hole mergers, GW170104 and GW170814, have been announced so far from this analysis, with the analysis of the data ongoing. These observations confirmed the existence of merging stellar mass black hole binaries originating in low metallicity environments. How to form merging binary black holes remains an open question theoretically. There are many proposed mechanisms, falling broadly into two families: 1) Isolated binary evolution and 2) dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. We show that comparing the distribution of observed black hole masses and spins to those predicted from population models will allow us to gain insight into how binary black holes form. We examine the measurements of the effective spin parameters for the 5 binary black hole observations published thus far and show that the data already exhibit a mild (2.7 sigma) preference for an isotropic distribution of spins over spins aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. Alternatively, dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes in these systems could be intrinsically small (average spin magnitude < 0.2), at odds with measurements of black hole spin magnitudes in high mass X-ray binaries. Both of these conclusions have implications for the formation of binary black holes, and the formation of heavy black holes in supernovae.%%%-%%%OzGrav postdoctoral fellow%%%sstevenson.jpg%%%-%%%spstevenson[at]swin.edu.au%%%sstevenson.pdf

Is this the first sign of new physics or merely a sign of systematic errors within individual probes? This key question remains unsolved, because there are only a handful of established probes. Here I will talk about how strong gravitational lensing offers a new window on precision cosmology, shining a new light on the dark Universe. <p>I will present strong lensing constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe and the equation of state of dark energy. I will also show how lensing combined with stellar dynamics yields the most precise test to date of the validity of General Relativity on extragalactic scales.%%%-%%%Dennis Sciama Fellow%%%tcollett.jpg%%%-%%%thomas.collett[at]port.ac.uk%%%tcollett.pdf

20171011%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Prof. Jeremy Mould%%%Swinburne University%%%How standard is the standard candle?%%%Over 25 years ago New York Times science writer Dennis Overbye wrote a book oddly titled Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos, narrating the saga of the measurement of distances in the expanding universe, beginning with Edwin Hubble’s first measurements and culminating in a controversy in the scientific literature between Allan Sandage, who had taken up Hubble’s mantle, and Texas astronomer, Gerard de Vaucouleurs. Stranger still, another NYT writer later reported that the film rights had been taken up, and that Tom Hanks had been invited to play Sandage. No movie was made, however, and the controversy was cleared up a few years later by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. The age of the expanding universe is now known to an accuracy of a few percent.</p><p>There is now a new urgency for increased accuracy in measurements of the Hubble Constant, the misnomer for the current epoch value of the accelerating expansion rate. Stellar Populations and the Distance Scale, sometimes called the distance ladder, as it ascends from the geometric diameter of the Earth’s orbit, has been joined by a rival ladder, descending from the surface of last scattering of the cosmic background radiation. They were expected to meet in the middle, but there seems to be a gap. Or is there? If there is, the standard model of cosmology, the Nobel prize winning &Lambda;CDM model, may be lacking something important. Is it another neutrino, curvature, or a dark matter-neutrino interaction? Right now, the jury is out, and the race for better data is on. Volume simulations indicate that sample variance is not an issue. Are supernovae really standard candles? The OzDES survey is adDr.essing this issue.</p><p>The Hubble Constant from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is a standard ruler, rather than a standard candle like supernovae. The ruler is simply the sound horizon at recombination. Simulations tell us that the linear regime for the evolution of structure pertains, and the ruler is unchanged in length in comoving coordinates to a fraction of a percent over the life of the Universe. The Taipan project is expected to achieve 1% accuracy in H0 (1&sigma;) from redshifts of over a million galaxies in the next 5 years. Between the high redshift of BAO and the low redshift of the Local Group, the Hubble Constant can be measured using gravitational lensing with no reference to stars. The H0liCow collaboration has results in agreement with the stellar pops distance scale. A convincing next step would be two independent stellar populations distance scales (Pop I & Pop II) agreeing to 1%.</p>%%%-%%%Professor%%%jmould.jpg%%%jmould_fig.jpg%%%jmould[at]swin.edu.au%%%-

20171004%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Luz &Aacutengela Garcia%%%Swinburne University%%%HI and metal absorption lines during the Epoch of Reionization%%%<p>In this work, we study the epoch of Reionization (EoR) with metal absorption lines in quasar spectra at high redshift, using high resolution hyDr.odynamical simulations (an improved version of GADGET-3). For this purpose, we set up the physical conditions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at the redshift of the EoR, and we post-process the simulations to implement a uniform UV ionizing background for quasars and galaxies (Haardt-Madau 2012), the metal ions with CLOUDY 8.1 and HI self-shielding prescription (Rahmati et al. 2013). We use Voigt profile fitting to compute the column densities of the ions from the synthetic spectra and obtain a statistical distribution of the absorbers. This procedure allows us to study the evolution of the state of the IGM at high redshift, compute the cosmological mass density of CIV and HI and other ions.  Our simulations produce absorbers properties that are in good agreement with observations in the literature, especially for the high ionization species.<p>Furthermore, we are able to reproduce an observed example of an LAE galaxy-CIV absorber pair at z=5.7, proving a physical insight into such systems beyond the limit of current observations. Finally, we vary of the uniform UVB at z~6, and compare directly with observations of different metal ions, in order to constrain the ionizing background at the tail of Reionization.%%%-%%%PhD student%%%langela.jpg%%%-%%%lgarcia[at]swin.edu.au%%%agarcia.pdf

Our new method tracks the physical properties of radio jets in massive galaxies, including the evolution of radio lobes and their impact on the surrounding gas. Unlike the previous efforts of Croton et al. 2006, we now self consistently track the cooling-heating cycle that significantly shapes the life and death of many types of galaxies. Adding jet physics to SAGE adds new physical properties to the model output, which in turn allows us to make more detailed predictions for the AGN and galaxy populations, and build customised AGN-focused mock survey catalogues for comparison with observations.%%%-%%%Professor%%%dcroton.jpg%%%-%%%dcroton[at]astro.swin.edu.au%%%dcroton.pdf

The oxidation of acid sulfate soils, coupled with potential release of heavy metals and acidic groundwaters, can have serious consequences for fragile ecosystems. Understanding these sediments will provide insight into the biogeochemical processes that affect the lifetimes of transient mineral species on Earth, and may be used to better understand soil acidification, contaminant mobility at sites affected by acid and metalliferous Dr.ainage, and even constrain past weathering and putative biosignatures on Mars.</p><p>Knowledge of the behaviour of jarosite minerals under the actual conditions that they are found in is crucial to understanding their potential environmental impacts on both Earth and Mars.

That Type Ia supernovae arise from exploding white dwarfs is relatively well-established but the manner in which the explosion is ignited and how this can be determined from what we observe remain hotly debated issues.</p><p>I will discuss the theoretical modelling of Type Ia supernovae with particular focus on how radiative transfer simulations can be used to test explosion scenarios. I will argue that understanding the diversity of thermonuclear supernovae requires us to investigate a variety of different progenitor scenarios. Specifically, I will present recent results from our work on both ChanDr.asekhar mass white dwarf explosion scenarios and sub-ChanDr.asekhar mass models.</p>%%%-%%%Lecturer/Associate Investigator (SkyMapper)</p>%%%ssim.jpg%%%-%%%s.sim[at]qub.ac.uk%%%ssim.pdf

20170802%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Prof. Garth Illingworth%%%University of California Santa Cruz%%%Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn: Exploring the First Billion Years with Hubble and Spitzer - Implications for JWST%%%Hubble has revolutionized the discovery and study of very distant galaxies through its deep imaging surveys. Together the HST WFC3/IR and ACS cameras have opened up the exploration of the universe in the first billion years after the Big Bang.  I will discuss what we have learned about the earliest galaxies during the reionization epoch at z>6 from the remarkable HST and Spitzer imaging surveys (e.g., HUDF/XDF, GOODS, HUDF09/12 and CANDELS), as well as surveys of galaxy clusters like the Frontier Fields (HFF). Lensing clusters provide extraordinary opportunities for characterizing the faintest earliest galaxies, but also present extraordinary challenges. Together these surveys have reliably established the volume density of galaxies in the first billion years down to extremely faint levels around -14.5 mag. The results from deep UV luminosity functions from Hubble, combined with the recent results from Planck, indicate that galaxies dominate the UV ionizing flux that reionized the universe. Some of the greatest surprises have come from the discovery of very luminous galaxies at z~8-11, around 400-650 million years after the Big Bang. Spectroscopic followup of these very rare, bright galaxies has confirmed redshifts from z~7 to z~11, and revealed, surprisingly, strong Lyα emission near the peak of reionization when the HI fraction in the IGM is high. The small sizes of galaxies at high redshifts, from analysis of the HFF cluster samples, reveal objects that, remarkably, are as small as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. The recent confirmation of a z=11.1 galaxy, just 400 million years after the Big Bang, by a combination of Hubble and Spitzer data, pushed Hubble into JWST territory, far beyond what we ever expected Hubble could do.  Twenty years of astonishing progress with Hubble and Spitzer leave me looking to JWST to provide even more remarkable exploration of the realm of the first galaxies at "Cosmic Sunrise".  The latest results on the sizes of distant galaxies, on the star formation rate density at z~10 and from Planck indicating that reionization began around z~10 together have significant implications for the detectability of the "first galaxies" with JWST.%%%-%%%Professor%%%gillingworth.jpg%%%-%%%gedi[at]ucolick.org%%%gillingworth.pdf

Conversely, a highly skilled, network of tech-savvy astronomers, brings enormous benefits to data-intensive astronomy research, for example better-handing of SKA, LSST and JWST data processing and products, data analysis and web–based tools to maximise early science discoveries and societal impact.</p><p>The ADASS, Python in Astronomy; .Astronomy (“dot astro”); Astro Hack Week; AAS, NAM and SPIE Hack Days, SciCoder and ANITA workshops bring together a diverse community of astronomers, instrument scientists, software developers, data archivists, wranglers, and educators. They provide a forum for discussing the latest tech tools, sharing skills and increasing digital literacy, promoting best practises in scientific computing, and the opportunity for astronomers to create innovative research and outreach tools in a collaborative environment. I will show how momentum is slowly building in this space; from bridging the gap between research astronomers, instrument scientists, and software developers; to increasing engagement  (and in some cases collaboration) with the tech industry, enhancing everyday astronomy research projects, and providing early and mid–career researchers with the critical tech and data science skills needed for careers in other sectors.</p><p>The Tech Savvy Astronomer (<a href='https://techsavvyastronomer.io/' target='_blank'>techsavvyastronomer.io</a>) website was created in response to the .Astronomy (“dotastro”) and Astro Hack Week conferences, and the growing need for community resources.

For most extragalactic sources, this estimation relies on photometric redshifts which require strong assumptions and can lead to catastrophic failures. In this talk I will explain how it is possible to use clustering measurements to infer redshifts for virtually any type of extragalactic sources. I will show how to turn this idea into a new tool for redshift estimation and show how accurate it is. I will then present applications of this "clustering-redshift" technique to various datasets at UV, optical, IR and radio wavelengths.%%%-%%%Faculty member%%%bmenard.jpeg%%%-%%%menard[at]jhu.edu%%%bmenard.pdf

It will use the newly-refurbished 1.2-metre UK Schmidt Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory with the new TAIPAN instrument, which includes an innovative ‘Starbugs’ positioning system capable of rapidly and simultaneously deploying up to 150 spectroscopic fibres over the 6-degree diameter focal plane, and a purpose-built spectrograph. The main scientific goals of Taipan are: (i) to measure the distance scale of the Universe (primarily governed by the local expansion rate, H0) to 1% precision, and the structure growth rate of structure to 5%; (ii) to make the most extensive map yet constructed of the mass distribution and motions in the local Universe, using peculiar velocities based on improved Fundamental Plane distances, which will enable sensitive tests of gravitational physics; and (iii) to deliver a legacy sample of low-redshift galaxies as a unique laboratory for studying galaxy evolution as a function of mass and environment. The Taipan survey will be the primary redshift and optical spectroscopic reference catalogue for the local Universe over the southern sky.%%%-%%%Director.

Over the last 5 decades, these laboratories have provided numerous breakthroughs, particular in the study of gravitation, where radio pulsar timing provided the first indirect evidence of gravitational waves and is poised to detect the low-frequency gravitational wave background created by binary supermassive black holes. What is remarkable is that so much of this progress has been made despite huge gaps in our knowledge about the laboratories themselves! In this talk I will discuss some of these gaps, the ongoing efforts to fill them in, and what the implications the success or failure of these efforts will have on future radio pulsar science with (for instance) the Square Kilometre Array.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow, Senior Lecturer%%%adeller.jpeg%%%-%%%adeller[at]astro.swin.edu.au%%%adeller.pdf

20170614%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Alessia Moretti%%%INAF-OaPD%%%Star formation quenching in cluster galaxies from integrated and spatially resolved spectra%%%The distribution of galaxy properties such as colors, morphologies, and star formation rates is broadly bimodal, with early type galaxies being statistically red and quiescent, and late type galaxies being blue and actively star forming. When, why and how galaxies become passive is a crucial question in modern astrophysics, and might be related to both the galaxy intrinsic properties, and to the environment in which galaxies live. In particular, the cluster/denser environments are particularly efficient in quenching the star formation and therefore represent an ideal place where investigating galaxy properties. I will present the results that we obtained by studying a large sample of low-redshift clusters for which we have been able to characterize the different populations of galaxies on their way to become passive. I will also report on the Eso GASP Large Program, that is devoted to the study of a sample of cluster and field galaxies that show signatures of gas stripping at various degrees. GASP makes use of the MUSE IFU spectrograph at VLT, and has already observed ~50% of its targets. I will show the results that we have obtained so far for jellyfish galaxies, and I will briefly report on the emerging connection between jellyfish galaxies and AGN activity in cluster galaxies.%%%-%%%Faculty%%%Moretti.png%%%Gas_Quenching_diagram.jpg%%%alessia.moretti[at]oapd.inaf.it%%%amoretti.pdf

20170607%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 6 Geoff Opat room%%%Dr. David Parkinson%%%University of Queensland%%%Testing for tensions between datasets%%%In cosmology, as in other areas of astrophysics, we are constrained to make observations of unrepeatable events (such as the Big Bang), and so have to proceed by statistical inference. The Bayesian approach  involves treating models and parameters similarly to data, as unknown variables with their own underlying probability distributions. However, as data from cosmological observables increases in constraining power, the opportunity arises for tensions between the different data sets, where the statistical limits on derived on certain parameters appears not to be coincident. This tensions can be generated either by an insufficient model, and so indicates the presence of new physics, by undiagnosed systematic errors, or simply by random statistical chance. In my talk I discuss different methods for diagnosing tensions, and show how these have been applied to the observed parameter tension between the cosmic microwave background data and measurements of the weak lensing shear power spectrum.%%%-%%%ARC Future Fellow, Senior Lecturer%%%dparkinson.jpg%%%-%%%d.parkinson[at]uq.edu.au%%%dparkinson.pdf

Despite major developments in the 1960s and decades of studies, we still don’t know what the necessary and sufficient conditions are for spiral arm formation.  Current efforts on the theory of spiral arm formation primarily focus on testing variations of density wave or swing amplifications on nearby galaxies.  Progress in this field is slow.  Breakthroughs can come from observations of high-redshift galaxies when spiral arms are in the early stage of formation.  In this talk, I will present my first results on integral field spectroscopic observations of the most ancient spiral galaxies at z>2, including gravitationally lensed galaxies.  The high-spatial resolution kinematic fields imply a population of rare spiral galaxies living in dynamically cold environments at high redshift.  I will discuss how ongoing follow-up IFS observations on a larger sample of spiral galaxies at z>2 can help to constrain the earliest onset mechanisms for spiral arms.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%yuantt.jpg%%%sprialarm.jpg%%%tiantian.yuan[at]anu.edu.au%%%-

20170524%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 7 conference room%%%Dr. Camila Correa%%%Leiden University%%%Morphology and color of EAGLE galaxy population%%%I investigate the dependence of kinematic-based galaxy morphology on intrinsic u-r colours and stellar mass in the EAGLE cosmological hyDr.odynamical simulations. I use the intrinsic colours and measured the fraction of kinetic energy invested in ordered rotation of 3562 galaxies at z=0 with stellar masses larger than 10^10 solar masses. I find that EAGLE produces a galaxy population whose morphology correlates with the colour bimodality for central and satellite galaxies alike. The red-sequence is mostly populated elliptical-type galaxies and most of blue-cloud galaxies are disc-type. I analyse gri-composite images of orderly rotating galaxies and show that many resolve a disc structure and spiral arms. These results show that the connection between mass, intrinsic colour and morphology arise naturally from galaxy formation models able to reproduce observed star formation relations and galaxy abundance distributions. In this talk I will discuss these findings, and use galaxy morphology (that holds clue to past merger history) and the galaxy distribution on the color-mass diagram to disentangle different evolutionary paths. In particular I will focus on the origin of red-sequence galaxies.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%ccorrea.jpeg%%%EagleHubble.jpg%%%cami.acorrea[at]gmail.com%%%-

Signatures of the baryon cycle such as IGM accretion, minor mergers, and stellar-Dr.iven outflows and fountains are best probed in gaseous halos, i.e., the circumgalactic medium (CGM). I use Keck, VLT, and HST spectra of background quasars to examine the geometric and kinematic properties of the multiphase, metal-enriched CGM of galaxies at 0.08&lt;z&lt;1.0, focusing on the low-ionization MgII and high-ionization OVI absorption doublets. By examining the velocity dispersions of absorbers in the context of the host galaxy color and orientation, I find that the low-ionization gas strongly traces expected baryon cycle processes. In contrast, high-ionization gas tends towards broader kinematics independent of galaxy color and orientation. These results suggest that the low- and high-ionization phases may trace different components of the CGM and provide observational constraints on simulations to accurately model the role that the baryon cycle plays in galaxy evolution.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral fellow%%%nnielsen.jpg%%%cgm.jpg%%%nikolenielsen[at]swin.edu.au%%%nnielsen.pdf

I will present work on the relationship between galaxies and metals seen in absorption towards higher redshift quasars. The relationship is investigated in two ways: globally and with individual galaxy-absorber pairs. We find that the Dr.op in the cosmic mass density of triply ionized Carbon, Omega(CIV), to redshift 5.5 cannot solely be explained by a decrease in the mean metallicty of the Universe over a short period of time. An additional change in the ionizing Background is required, in line with findings of increased neutrality of hyDr.ogen at the same redshift. Our analysis of galaxy-absorber pairs finds that low luminosity galaxies close to the quasar line of sight are the most likely source of metal absorbers at these redshifts.%%%Special Date%%%Associate Professor%%%eweber.jpg%%%Reionization-timeline.jpg%%%eryanweber[at]swin.edu.au%%%eweber.pdf

However, due to cooling, gas that accretes onto haloes and filaments does not always heat to the virial temperature, leading to unstable, free falling gas (a.k.a "cold flows"). I will summarize old theoretical results about accretion onto haloes, and present some recent work of gas accretion onto filaments. Once cold flows penetrate through hot virialized haloes, supersonic Kelvin Helmholtz instability occurs, with specific patterns of unstable KH modes. Finally, as cold flows smash into the galaxy, magnetic fields can play a non-trivial role in the way this gas actually mixes with the ISM.%%%-%%%Senior Lecturer%%%no_image.png%%%-%%%yuval[at]phys.huji.ac.il%%%ybirnboim.pptx
