<h2>Abstract</h2>
This talk  focuses on detection of a sinusoidal signal with randomly varying frequency and phase. I will first review methods which have been developed over the past 70 years for estimating and tracking sinusoidal signals with varying frequency, including the extended Kalman filter solution. I will then introduce some of our proposed detection techniques covering hidden Markov model based detector, optimal Bayesian detectors implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, optimal likelihood ratio detectors using the estimator-correlator structure and nonlinear optimal filtering, and finally, a least square based detector implemented using optimal control of a bilinear system.
