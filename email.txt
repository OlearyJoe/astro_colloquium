<h2>Abstract</h2>
I will present my work on advancing binary evolution models, which are used to describe and calculate rates of merging black holes and neutrons stars observed by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. Current models include simple approximations for the binary orbit changes during all types of mass transfer and angular momentum loss. I instead work on characterising these interactions using hydrodynamic simulations, and understand how the loss of mass and angular momentum will effect the final population of merging compact objects.
