<h2>Abstract</h2>
Galaxies live in dark matter haloes and hence the galaxy properties are majorly defined by the properties of the haloes. Thus the environmental dependence of dark matter halo properties prompts a correlation between galaxy properties and the environment. In this talk, I will discuss the results from our recent works (arXiv:2102.04177 and arXiv:2201.10480) that explored how luminosities in various passbands and the associated galaxy properties are correlated with the environment. We used a set of 3.4 micro-m luminosity-selected and stellar mass-selected galaxies from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We made use of the galaxy two-point correlation functions and marked correlation functions to investigate the environmental correlations. I will also discuss the impact of various selection effects on the galaxy clustering measurements.
