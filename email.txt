<h2>Abstract</h2>
Using high-resolution spectroscopy, the atomic/molecular bands in the spectrum of an exoplanet are resolved into individual absorption lines. The variation of Doppler shifts caused by the planetâ€™s orbital motion enables absorption lines in the exoplanet spectrum to be distinguished from telluric lines. By combining thousands of unique absorption (or emission) lines, the atomic/molecular signatures can be identified unambiguously and detected at high significance. As it is sensitive to the position of the lines, it also allows us to measure the planetary rotation and wind velocity, as well as search for atmospheric variability and inhomogeneity during the transit. In this talk, I will give a review on how we characterise the atmosphere of exoplanets using high-resolution spectroscopy including some of the latest discoveries in the atmosphere of ultra-hot Jupiters.
