<h2>Abstract</h2>
In January 2020, the LIGO and Virgo observatories twice detected gravitational waves from the inspiral and merger of neutron stars with black holes. In this talk, I will describe the detection and characterization of this observation of a new source of gravitational waves, which also represents the first observation of neutron star-black hole binaries.
