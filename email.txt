<h2>Abstract</h2>
In January 2020, the LIGO and Virgo observatories detected gravitational waves from the inspiral and merger of two neutron star-balck hole binaries. In this talk, I will describe the detection and characterization of this first observation of a new source of gravitational waves, which also represents the first observation of neutron star-blackh hole binaries.
