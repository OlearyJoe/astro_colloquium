<h2>Abstract</h2>
Studying the statistical properties of high redshift galaxies is crucial for understanding the overall picture of galaxy formation and evolution. In this talk, I will present our latest results from ~4,000,000 galaxies at z~2-7 identified in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. This large sample has allowed us to reveal 1) rest-frame UV luminosity functions in a very wide luminosity range, 2) the number density excess of bright galaxies beyond the classical Schechter function, and 3) the almost constant star formation efficiency at z~2-7, suggesting that the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density is primarily driven by the structure formation and the cosmic expansion. Extrapolation of this result to higher redshifts suggests a sharp decline of the star formation rate density at z>10, which is consistent with our recent finding of z~13 galaxy candidates and will be directly tested with JWST. Finally, I will briefly introduce our planned JWST Cycle 1 observations.
