<h2>Abstract</h2>
In cosmology, as in other areas of astrophysics, we are constrained to
make observations of unrepeatable events (such as the Big Bang), and so
have to proceed by statistical inference. The Bayesian approach involves
treating models and parameters similarly to data, as unknown variables
with their own underlying probability distributions. However, as data
from cosmological observables increases in constraining power, the
opportunity arises for tensions between the different data sets, where
the statistical limits on derived on certain parameters appears not to
be coincident. This tensions can be generated either by an insufficient
model, and so indicates the presence of new physics, by undiagnosed
systematic errors, or simply by random statistical chance. In my talk I
discuss different methods for diagnosing tensions, and show how these
have been applied to the observed parameter tension between the cosmic
microwave background data and measurements of the weak lensing shear
power spectrum.
