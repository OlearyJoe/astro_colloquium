Detailed measurements are now required to better constrain feedback models and to establish how outflows influence the properties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. In this talk, I will highlight recent spatially resolved studies of outflows at z~2, focusing on the launch mechanisms of star-formation-driven outflows and the variety of ways in which outflows couple AGN accretion energy to gas on nuclear, galactic and circumgalactic scales. At the end, I will discuss ongoing efforts to make robust measurements of the abundances of metal ions in the circumgalactic medium at z>5.5, with the goal of understanding the mechanisms governing the production and transport of metals in the early Universe.%%%-%%%ASTRO 3D Postdoctoral Research Associate%%%rdavies.png%%%-%%%rdavies[at]swinburne.edu.au%%%rdavies.pdf

The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) provides a unique new way to probe the ionized baryons in the IGM. Cosmological models with different parameters lead to different DM-redshift (DM−z) relations. Additionally, the over/under-dense regions in the IGM and intervening galaxies' circumgalactic medium lead to scattering around the mean DM−z relations. I will present the recent work I have done using the Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) simulations to study the DM-z relation, and the scatter around it. I find that almost all of the FRBs found at low-redshifts have significantly larger observed DMs than predicted from simulations. I will also show that we would need of the order 9000 localised FRBs to constrain AGN feedback efficiency. Finally I will talk about a future project measuring the metallicity of the IGM in EAGLE and the sizes of ‘metal bubbles’ around galaxies at the end of the epoch of reionisation. %%%-%%%PhD Student%%%abatten.jpg%%%-%%%abatten[at]swin.edu.au%%%abatten.mp4
astro_colloquium.txt:20210526%%%12:00 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 2, Hercus Theatre (+Zoom)%%%Dr Rob Bassett%%%Swinburne University%%%3D Galaxy Shape Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks%%%It has been nearly a century since the great debate was put to rest by Hubble, who definitively proved that many nebulae were truly "island universes" akin to our own Milky Way. Since then, millions of galaxies have been discovered, yet one relatively simple question remains open: what are the true three dimensional shapes of galaxies? The intangible nature of observational astronomy means that any one galaxy provides a single, two dimensional perspective, and it is this aspect of our field that makes this question so difficult to answer. In this talk, I will give an overview of the history of galaxy 3D shape research from statistical photometric studies up to more recent advances incorporating galaxy kinematics with integral field spectroscopy. I will then present critical tests we have performed of these recent methods that incorporate mock IFS from cosmological hydrodynamics simulations (from which the true 3D shapes are known). These tests have revealed striking biases in the recovered shapes of galaxies that have spurred us in a new direction: machine learning and neural networks. I will finish with our preliminary results in galaxy shape prediction with these modern techniques, which may provide an important step forward in this fundamental area of research.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Fellow%%%rbassett.jpg%%%-%%%rbassett[at]swin.edu.au%%%rbassett.mp4

The length of time oral traditions can be passed down while maintaining vitality is a topic of ongoing debate. Scientific techniques have been utilised to date natural events described in oral tradition, such as volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and meteorite impacts to provide a terminus ante quem for the origin or development of these oral traditions. In this talk, we analyse Tasmanian Aboriginal (palawa) oral traditions recorded in the early nineteenth century that describe the flooding of the Bassian Land Bridge connecting Tasmania to mainland Australia, as well as the presence of a culturally significant “Great South Star”. Using astro-chronological and geo-chronological techniques, we show that these traditions have a terminus ante quem of approximately 12,000 years.%%%-%%%Associate Professor In Cultural Astronomy%%%dhamacher.jpg%%%-%%%duane.hamacher[at]unimelb.edu.au%%%dhamacher.mp4

These massive quiescent galaxies (MQG) have proven difficult to reproduce in sufficient numbers in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. While the latest generation of simulations have begun to achieve more consistent number densities through detailed prescriptions of AGN feedback, the observed quenched galaxies still appear to quench at earlier epochs. This begs the question: how early in the Universe can we still find quiescent galaxies? Additionally, high redshift MQGs host old stellar populations that can provide insights into the star-formation conditions during the epoch of reionisation. The intense star-bursts that likely formed MQGs are expected to have a different distribution of stellar masses, the initial-mass function (IMF), compared to local elliptical galaxies. I present work done to identify these rare MQGs at high redshift based on the FENIKS survey and determine some of their physical properties using a combination of deep HST imaging and MOSFIRE spectra.%%%-%%%PhD Student%%%jesdaile.png%%%-%%%jesdaile[at]swin.edu.au%%%jesdaile.key

New low-frequency radio telescopes able to probe the neutral hydrogen in the high-redshift Universe (z~6-30) come in two flavours: single-antennas that probe the average thermal history of the Universe (such as EDGES, SARAS and REACH), and interferometers that measure the spatial fluctuations of 21cm emission (such as HERA, MWA and SKA). </p><p> Both come with an extraordinary challenge: bright foregrounds amplify small spectral "features" in the instrument, obscuring the background signal unless calibrated to one part in 10^5. Accounting for these effects is susceptible to inadvertant removal of part of the signal, which has led to several retractions of published upper-limits over the past decade. Add to this the extremely surprising results from EDGES in 2018, and we must ask: how much can we trust the results of 21cm experiments, and how can we build confidence amongst the community? </p><p> In this talk, I will discuss my role in answering these questions with two current 21cm experiments -- EDGES and HERA. </p><p> EDGES is working to verify its result from 2018 using new and improved data and improved analysis techniques. I will describe our new effort to forward-model systematics, starting with receiver calibration and simple models for the antenna reflection coefficients, showing the effects of propagating their full correlated uncertainties on the cosmological estimates. </p><p> Concerning HERA, I will report on the work of the Validation team (Aguirre et al., 2021), in support of our recent first upper limit (Kern et al., 2021). We produced a sophisticated end-to-end simulation of the full observation, including thermal noise, realistic foregrounds and many instrumental systematics. This simulation was processed with the exact analysis pipeline used for the data. I will discuss our philosophy and findings, with special regards for future improvements.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Researcher%%%smurray.jpg%%%-%%%steven.g.murray[at]asu.edu%%%smurray.mp4
astro_colloquium.txt:20210428%%%12 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 2, Hercus Theatre (+Zoom)%%%Dr Nikole M. Nielsen%%%Swinburne University%%%The Circumgalactic Medium at Cosmic Noon with KCWI%%%The star formation history of the universe reveals that galaxies most actively build their stellar mass at "cosmic noon" (z=1-3). The gas accreting onto galaxies to drive their construction and the resulting metal-enriched material ejected from these galaxies due to feedback must pass through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The CGM is a massive reservoir of diffuse, multiphase gas out to ~200 kpc and is the interface between the intergalactic medium and the galaxy. While the CGM is well-studied at z<1, little attention has been paid to the reservoir when star formation is most active, due to the difficulty in identifying host galaxies at cosmic noon. The installation of the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI), a sensitive integral field spectrograph, on Keck II has opened a new window to quickly identify galaxies via their Lyman alpha emission at cosmic noon as well as to directly image the CGM in emission. I will introduce two new surveys with KCWI aiming to study the CGM in (1) absorption around galaxies at z=2-3 and (2) emission around local starbursting galaxies (cosmic noon analogues). These surveys are still in progress, but first results reveal strong outflows at cosmic noon and tantalising sub-kiloparsec structure in the CGM.%%%-%%%Postdoctoral Research Associate%%%nnielsen.jpg%%%cgm.jpg%%%nikolenielsen[at]swin.edu.au%%%nnielsen.mp4
astro_colloquium.txt:20210421%%%12:00 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 2, Hercus Theatre (+Zoom)%%%Dr Jielai Zhang%%%Swinburne University%%%Simultaneous Multi-Wavelength Observations (Gamma, X-ray, UV, Optical, and Radio) of Two FRBs%%%Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond bursts in the radio, so bright that we observe them in distant galaxies at a rate of over 1000/day over the whole sky with large radio facilities. Despite their frequency and high energy output, what causes these bursts have eluded astronomers since their discovery over a decade ago. FRBs may result from magnetar bursts, binary neutron star mergers (producing kilonovae), neutron stars collapsing to black holes (blitzars) or several other theories.  Information on emission coherent with the radio burst in other wavelengths can help reveal the physical processes that create these bursts.  I present results from an observational program that can do this called the Deeper Faster Wider (DWF) program. A key part of the DWF program is coordinating ~10 multi-wavelength observatories to perform deep, wide-field, fast cadence observations on the same field simultaneously to collect possible imaging on fast-evolving transients before they fade. Importantly, DWF can collect data before, during and after fast transients. Typically, a DWF observing run goes for a week.  In particular, I present results from DWF operation run 8 (DWF-O8). During DWF-O8, two FRBs were detected with the Murriyang Radio Telescope (formerly known as the Parkes Radio Telescope). Simultaneously observing with Murriayng was the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory , Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope, AstroSat, the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network, the Huntsman Telescope, Murriyang and the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope, amongst others. %%%-%%%Postdoctoral Researcher%%%jzhang.png%%%-%%%jielaizhang[at]swin.edu.au%%%jzhang.mp4

Most studies use injection-recovery simulations to determine completeness functions. Although conceptually the same, these simulations have subtle but important differences in their definition of the completeness function across existing studies. In turn, this requires implementation of different methods to obtain the final determination of the UVLFs. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of existing methods using a reference set of mock observations, and then compare the methods when applied to the same set of Hubble Legacy Field (HLF) images. We find that some methods may suffer limitations in a presence of substantial photometric scatter and/or steep luminosity functions.%%%-%%%-%%%nleethochawalit.png%%%-%%%nicha.leethochawalit@unimelb.edu.au%%%-
astro_colloquium.txt:20210317%%%12:00 p.m.%%%David Caro building, Level 2, Hercus Theatre (+Zoom)%%%Prof. David Jamieson%%%University of Melbourne%%%Galileo's astronomical observations: when pushing back the frontiers was risky business%%%Galileo's prolific letters to friends, colleagues, patrons and other associates are valuable treatises in their own right.  A letter he wrote on 21 December 1613 to a former student in Prague sets out his forthright views on the relationship between religious doctrine and science.  Galileo's letter found its way into the hands of the Inquisition in Rome and this ultimately led to Galileo's conviction of "vehement suspicion of heresy".  Galileo must have realised his letter would cause trouble because he claimed the letter passed to the authorities in Rome had been altered by malevolent forces out to damage him and strengthen their case for heresy.  He released a new version of the letter with much less inflammatory language which he claimed was the original.  In a sensational discovery in the library of the Royal Society in London UK, Galileo's claim of alteration is shown to be false.  Incorrectly filed for 250 years, the original of the inflammatory letter was accidentally rediscovered in 2018, with edits in Galileo's own handwriting to tone down the language.  This is a remarkable piece of history about a physicist facing dire consequences at the hands of the authorities.  A particular passage in the letter has captured my attention.  Galileo wrote "This (scientific knowledge) applies especially to those sciences about which one can read only very small phrases and scattered conclusions in the Scripture as is particularly the case for astronomy, of which it contains such a small portion that one does not even find in it the names of all the planets."  I will link this statement back to Galileo's observations of the planet Neptune that occurred in December 1612 to January 1613 just on one year before he wrote his inflammatory letter.  We may be able to glean new insights into his thinking at the time.%%%-%%%-%%%djamieson.png%%%-%%%d.jamieson@unimelb.edu.au%%%-
