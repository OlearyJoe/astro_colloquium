<section><h2>Exploring tests of gravity with the relativistic double neutron star PSR J1757-1854</h2></section>
<section><i>Pulsars in relativistic binary systems are some of the most useful laboratories available for testing relativistic theories of gravity in the strong field regime.  In this talk, I will highlight the latest results from a 6-year observing campaign of the double neutron star system PSR J1757-1854, a 21.5-ms pulsar in an eccentric 4.4-hour orbit and one of the most extreme relativistic binaries currently known. These results include the first detection of geodetic precession in the system, an evaluation of the current utility of the pulsarâ€™s post-Keplerian tests of gravity, and an assessment of the new and uncommon tests that will become available in the near future with continuing observations.</i></section>
