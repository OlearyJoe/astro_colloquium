<section><h2>Galaxy Evolution with ASTRO 3D</h2></section>
<section><i>ASTRO 3D is an Australian Centre of Excellence with 300+ members united in understanding the evolution of the matter, light, and elements from the Big Bang to the present day. Here I highlight results from two of our flagship surveys. The MOSEL survey confirms a population of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies in the distant universe and suggests that most galaxies go through a strong starburst phase. By comparing galaxy kinematics to cosmological simulations, we show that massive galaxies in the distant universe build their stellar mass mostly by accreting other galaxies, and that puffy galaxies quench slower than compact galaxies. Gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmic tool for exploring a wide range of astrophysical phenomena including understanding how ordinary and dark matter couple and finding the earliest galaxies and stars. Using Convolutional Neural Networks to sift through legacy imaging data-sets, the AGEL survey confirms about 100 strong gravitational lenses. I provide an overview of the AGEL survey and describe AGEL projects based on observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, Keck Observatory, and the Very Large Telescope.</i></section>
