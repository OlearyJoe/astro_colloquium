<section><h2>From Interstellar Turbulence to Star Formation</h2></section>
<section><i>The formation of stars is controlled by the interplay between gravity, interstellar turbulence, magnetic fields, and stellar feedback. In this talk, I will try to explain the link between these processes and how they shape the structure of molecular clouds, paving the way towards star formation. A lot of this is based on supercomputer simulations and theoretical models, however, the design of the simulations and theoretical models is ultimately guided by observational evidence.</i></section>
