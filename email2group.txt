<section><h2>Supernova outbursts, crashes, and flashes, and a small satellite concept</h2></section>
<section><i>I will cover three topics:</p><p>1. "Bells not Whistles":  Some massive stars undergo shock-driven outbursts before the cores collapse.  I will show that nonlinear acoustics rules out a standard explanation for how these events are driven, a result that deepens the mystery of their origin.</p><p>2. "Do crashes make flashes?": Compact supernovae can be aspherical enough to fling ejecta sideways, causing collisions outside the progenitor.   I address the open question: can a circumstellar collision ever be visible from afar, or will it be smothered by the ejecta surrounding it?</p><p>3. "The LUVS small satellite concept."   This would be an instrument to perform rapid ultraviolet alert follow-up and chase binary neutron star coalescence signals.  It is also a testbed for fast, cheap, off-the-shelf mission development in the New Space paradigm, intended to show that scaling laws, which say space must be hard, can be broken.</i></section>
